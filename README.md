# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***
`` ` `` are for code snippets, `#` is used for various header sizes, `1.` is used for a enumerated list.

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***
1. Stirfry
1. Burgers
1. Pasta
1. Fresh Bread
  1. Italian Bread
  1. Sourdough Bread
1. BBQ
  * Chicken
  * Pork

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***
### My Heading

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

```Java
for (var i=0; i<=10; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

Reactive | Integrated | Interactive | Connected
---------|------------|-------------|----------
IoT devices often utilize sensors to see their environment and make changes | Devices are often integrated as part of a larger whole. | Devices often have ways for a user to interact with them, usually through the use of a mobile app or website. | As a part of the other three, the devices must be able to communicate with the world through internet, bluetooth or some other medium.

Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***

1. Smart Watch
  1. https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/322670/the-best-smartwatches
  1. A smart watch such a Fitbit or Apple Watch is a small computer you can wear on your wrist, similar to a smart phone and is usually connected to a smartphone as well.
  1. My description of IoT devices applies fairly well here. They are reactive to both user inputs, either through touch interfaces, buttons, movement sensors and many more. They are interactive with LCD, LED or OLED screens, and are connected to other devices through bluetooth.
1. Self Driving Cars
  1. https://www.iotforall.com/iot-and-autonomous-vehicles/
  1. A self driving car is capable of navigating roads and driving to a destination with no input from the user
  1. This also fits my description fairly well. They are certainly reactive and interactive, by avoiding hazards on the roads and receiving inputs for destination. However, though they often are connected to servers, such as Google, they don't have to be.

## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***
